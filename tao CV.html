        <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
        <p> As a former student of Seirin highschool and a first-string member of the Seirin basket ball club, I do consider the next step of my career as an athlete. 
            <br>
            Through many social network information and news, I know that Kyoto University has earned a big reputation in basketball field for years.
            <br>
            As aforementioned consideration, I think it would be a very great honour for me to continue my studying progress at Kyoto University, and also to pursuade a more professional basketball career as a member of your team.
